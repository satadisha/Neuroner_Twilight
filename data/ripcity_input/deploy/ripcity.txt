Won't make the playoffs.

Can't beat the Thunder with their starting center down and backup playing with one arm.

Their star guards can't win in the playoffs, anyway.

And now there's no way they can win game 7 on the road.

Won't make the playoffs.

Can't beat the Thunder with their starting center down and backup playing with one arm.

Their star guards can't win in the playoffs, anyway.

And now there's no way they can win game 7 on the road.

Right...?
